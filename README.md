# Kiwi Garage
At Kiwi Garage we build open source tools for infrastructure monitoring, documents management, incident handling and scheduling of maintenance window. In the spirit of freedom, we draw our inspiration from the father of open source Richard Stallman who believed that softwares should be "free" but not the price.

# Our Vision
We want to be a leading foundation for open-source Infrastructure monitoring software, where great ideas become real products that make a difference.

# What we are Working on.

### NetDocs (Development Ongoing) - This is an infrastructure documentation management system that aims to keep an updated version of systems and processes. The goal is to ensure that whenever their is a change implemented in an onfrstructure, this system will keep a record of the change implemented for future references.
